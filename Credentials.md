## Write-Up
The `Leak_stuff.rar` file provided in the challenge contains a folder named `Leak stuff`.

Inside the said folder, there are 2 text files: `passwd.txt` and `user.txt`. This is likely the leaked credentials found on the black market as stated in the challenge description.

This is what the contents of `passwd.txt` look like:

Each line contains a password hash or encrypted password AKA the leaked passwords.

On the other hand, this is the contents of `user.txt`:

Each line contains a username AKA the leaked usernames.

The goal of this challenge is to find and decrypt the password for the user `osman`.

Based on the hint, each username in user.txt corresponds to the respective password in passwords.txt at the same position in the list.

A quick search reveals that the user `osman` can be found on line 337 in `user.txt`.

Also, on line 337 of `passwd.txt`, an encrypted password was found: `ZJPB{e6g180g9f302g8d8gddg1i2174d0e212}`, which appeared suspicious as it closely matches the flag format used in Wargames.MY, specifically `WGMY{hash}`.

Moving on, to determine the cypher used to encrypt the passwords, [dCode's Cipher Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) is an excellent tool.

The results show that there is a chance that the cypher used is Caesar cypher/ROT cypher which is a monoalphabetic substitution cypher, where each letter is replaced by another letter located a little further in the alphabet (therefore shifted but always the same for the given cypher message).

Using the brute force function of the [Caesar Cipher Decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) in dCode, we can decrypt the osman's encrypted password easily.

From the results obtained, a suspicious string was observed at the left shift of 3 (ðŸ œ3) or equivalently a right shift of 23 (ðŸ ž23). The string matched the expected WGMY{...} flag format, confirming the correct decryption step.

#### Flag: `WGMY{b6d180d9c302d8a8daad1f2174a0b212}`
