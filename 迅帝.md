## Write-Up
The goal of this challenge is to find the `Melancholy Angel` which is said to be holding the flag to this challenge.

A quick online search on the suspicious challenge name `迅帝` shows that it is related to `Shutokō Battle Rival` which is a Japanese car racing game.
> Shutokō Battle Rival is a racing game in the Shutokō Battle series, also known as the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series outside of Japan. The game is developed by Genki and is part of the popular Shutokō Battle franchise, which focuses on street racing on the highways of Tokyo.

Another search reveals that the `Melancholy Angel` is actually a character inside the game, specifically in `ITC` which stands for `Import Tuner Challenge` (as shown in the figures below).
>Melancholy Angel (also known as Gloomy Angel in Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift 2, Dejected Angel in Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, and Unhappy Angel in Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero Gloomy Angel) is a recurring boss in the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series. She drives a custom Mazda RX-8, called Melancholy Angel (SE3PCuMA), with angel wings mounted above the rear window, heart-shaped exhaust tips, and a pink driver's seat.

><b>Important Find!</b> It has an index number of <b>182</b> in the list of rivals.

Also, based on the challenge description, the duration of waiting which is `18 years` indicates that the item that we are finding was published in `2006`.

Exploring the [Shutokō Battle Rival Database](https://genkirivalproject.fandom.com/) (home/index page of the above wiki page), we can see that the `Import Tuner Challenge` game was released in `2006` as well, which confirms that `ITC` is the key of this challenge.

Plus, the hint (YouTube video link) confirms that ITC 2006 is definitely involved.

A lookup on `bms script` reveals that BMS scripts are often used to extract and unpack game files and the scripts can be run with [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm). 
>QuickBMS is a versatile tool created by Luigi Auriemma for handling file extraction, decryption, and data manipulation tasks. It is used primarily for unpacking proprietary file formats in games and software. QuickBMS requires scripts written in the BMS scripting language to know how to handle specific file formats.
