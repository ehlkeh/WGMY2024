## Write-Up
The goal of this challenge is to find the `Melancholy Angel`, which is said to be holding the flag to this challenge.

A quick online search on the suspicious challenge name `迅帝` shows that it is related to `Shutokō Battle Rival`, a Japanese car racing game.
> Shutokō Battle Rival is a racing game in the Shutokō Battle series, also known as the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series outside of Japan. The game is developed by Genki and is part of the popular Shutokō Battle franchise, which focuses on street racing on the highways of Tokyo.

Another search reveals that the `Melancholy Angel` is actually a character within the game, specifically in `ITC`, which stands for `Import Tuner Challenge` (as shown in the figures below).
>Melancholy Angel (also known as Gloomy Angel in Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift 2, Dejected Angel in Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, and Unhappy Angel in Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero Gloomy Angel) is a recurring boss in the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series. She drives a custom Mazda RX-8, called Melancholy Angel (SE3PCuMA), with angel wings mounted above the rear window, heart-shaped exhaust tips, and a pink driver's seat.

Also, based on the challenge description, the duration of waiting — `18 years` — indicates that the item being searched for was published in `2006`.

Exploring the [Shutokō Battle Rival Database](https://genkirivalproject.fandom.com/) (the home/index page of the above wiki), it is discovered that the `Import Tuner Challenge (ITC)` game was also released in `2006`, which confirms that ITC is related to this challenge.

Additionally, the hint provided — the [YouTube video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9wUceoDEdY) — further confirms that `ITC 2006` is definitely involved in the challenge.

Now, to read the `TOC` and `DAT` files given in the challenge:

In the context of games, .DAT and .TOC are commonly used in games to store:

>+ .TOC: Table of Contents (pointers to data within the .DAT file).

A quick search online using the keywords `Import Tuner DAT file` reveals a discussion on the `Import Tuner Challenge (XBOX360)`, which mentions using the `tokyo_xtreme_racer.bms` script to dump the game's .DAT and .TOC files.

The next step is to find and run this script.

A lookup on `bms script` reveals that BMS scripts are commonly used to extract and unpack game files. and these scripts can be run with [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm). 
>QuickBMS is a versatile tool created by Luigi Auriemma for handling file extraction, decryption, and data manipulation tasks. It is used primarily for unpacking proprietary file formats in games and software. QuickBMS requires scripts written in the BMS scripting language to know how to handle specific file formats.

To download `QuickBMS`, click on the first link [`QuickBMS generic files extractor and reimporter 0.12`](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip) on the QuickBMS page.

This will download a zip file named `quickbms.zip`. Unzip it for later use.

With the files, tool, and script ready, the following step is to begin extracting and dumping the game files. 
>Recall that DAT and TOC files were provided for this challenge.

For easier file management, it is recommended to place all the relevant files in the QuickBMS tool folder, as shown below.

Since the GUI version of the tool did not work for some reason, the command-line version of QuickBMS was used for this challenge.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06fe78be-237f-4e45-bb7f-a440e679b2d8)

To start, open a terminal in the directory where the file is located and type the following command:
```./quickbms.exe tokyo_xtreme_racer.bms BUILD.TOC extracted_files/```
>+ tokyo_xtreme_racer.bms: The QuickBMS script file to run.
>+ BUILD.TOC: The TOC file that maps and references data stored in the associated BUILD.DAT file that is going to be extracted. <b>Optional: It is possible to directly use BUILD.DAT instead of BUILD.TOC here.</b> It gives the same results.
>+ extracted_files/: The directory where the extracted files will be saved.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fa72284-736b-4dbd-837e-63d04174bd32)

When the command is run, the tool will prompt to create a new folder if the folder specified in the command doesn't already exist. If the folder is not created, entering 'y' will allow the process to continue.

After that, the script will continue running, dumping the extracted files from the BUILD.DAT file into the `extracted_files/` directory.

This is what the terminal looks like once the script finishes its execution:

There will be <b>22995</b> files extracted, amounting to a whopping size of 2.39GB:

To efficiently browse through this large number of files, `Autopsy` was utilised. This unconventional yet highly effective approach made it possible to sift through the files at a much faster pace:

At the 188th TGA file, the `Melancholy Angel` was discovered, with the flag printed all over her.
